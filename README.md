# ReflectionClassExplorer
Analyze classes within jar files to identify class data such as fields, methods(name, return type, parameter types), and constructors.

Instructions -
Load a jar file using the interface.  Enter the path of the class file you wish to analyze within the jar file.

ex. We have a jar file, Shapes.jar which contains a class, Circle.class, within the following package:

org/shapes/Circle.class

We would enter the class name as org.shapes.Circle and then hit the get data button
